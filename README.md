To run this code, you'll need to have Python installed on your machine. Here are the steps to execute the provided Python script:

    Install Required Libraries:
        Open a terminal or command prompt.
        Install the required libraries using the following command:

    pip install cryptography apscheduler tk flask flask-talisman jsonify

Run the Script:

    Open a terminal or command prompt.
    Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python script.
    Run the script using the following command:

        python flask_server.py
        python encryption_app.py

    Observe Output:
        The script will generate an encrypted message and then attempt to decrypt it, printing the results to the console.

Note: Make sure to have the necessary permissions to write to the file system, as the code involves storing and loading the encryption key from a file.

Additionally, keep in mind that this script is a demonstration and uses a static key for simplicity. In a real-world scenario, you should implement secure key generation and storage practices.
